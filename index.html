      <p>TINYVICES REDUX</p>

      <p>This website is an archive of a website. The original tinyvices site was turned off (by me) around 2010 and was succeeded by a different but related web project called Time & Space that only ran for a few years. Both were curatorial projects I started when the web still felt like wild new arena with infinite possibility. I wanted to re-activate this site as an archive because I loved this project and always regretted turning it off. At the time, social media was swallowing everything, and it felt pointless to keep an independent site like this going. But now, after over a decade of surfing our constant feeds, I feel like there’s space for something like this to serve its purpose again. Maybe its just nostalgia (and I’ve always been a sucker for nostalgia) but I want to have a place to look at stuff again without feeding some corpo-algorithm-data-mining-advertising-machine. Also this archive represents a lot of time and energy from me and the people who contributed their work and it’s weird that it was just gone. I always wanted to make a big tinyvices book (and maybe still will) but this thing was always meant to be a weird, simple, homemade website. Not to be too sentimental (or too jaded), but this project represents to me a time and energy when the internet seemed like it had the potential to be an actual positive force, before everything became a polarizing-profit-driven-clickbait-hellscape. And not to be to be all mushy, but this project was really motivated by a youthful love of the idea of a global community of creatively interested people. I still love that idea and hope by re-activating this site I can rekindle that a bit.</p>

      <p>There are images in this archive that might not have been published on the original site. When I shut down the original site there was a back-log of submissions that I hadn’t gotten to publish yet. Adding work to the site was way more time-consuming back then, so I was always way behind on updating new submissions. So, when I was going through the archive re-organizing it for this re-launch I decided to include some of these previously unshared works. Also - various photos explanation</p>

      <p>This site was made to look at on a big screen. It works on your phone, but for best results, please find the biggest computer screen to look around on here.</p>

      <p>Important disclaimers : All the work on this site was submitted by the credited artists. These artists own their copyrights and are responsible for their own work. I am not an art dealer or agent, so please do not contact me about other people's work. If your work is on this site and you would like me to remove it for any reason, please just email me and I’ll remove it right away. Also if you see any mistakes, miss-spelled names, miss-representations, incorrect credits on work or anything else you’d like me to fix or address, please just send me an email with the details. Screenshots would be helpful for this if possible.</p>

      <p>The following is a long winded history of this project. I wanted to write it out here to give this big pile of images some context :</p>


      <p>I started tinyvices.com in 2005. That year was my second (and last) year working as the photo editor for Vice magazine, and I thought it would be fun to have an outlet to share photography and art that I was discovering through that job and from the overlapping art scenes I was involved in. I had studied photography at Emily Carr in Vancouver Canada before moving to NYC in 2003, so I had connections to young art scenes in both countries and on both coasts. A few of my friends had started photo/art-centric websites, a relatively new practice in those days, and they inspired me to do the same. Terence Koh, a friend from Vancouver, was an early online-pioneer with his multifaceted web-art-project Asian Punk Boy. Amy Kellner’s Teenage Unicorn was a funny and ernest window into her eclectic downtown New York life. Patrick O’Dell had started Epicly Later’d, a diaristic stream of snapshots and captions from his adventures as a skate & portrait photographer. Patrick actually taught me how to build my site using Netscape Navigator. The program was simplistic and tedious but the outcome was something that felt novel and exciting for its time: a quick and seemingly limitless space to share and connect to a newly forming world wide web. Tinyvices started as a mostly straightforward photo blog, but along with my crummy, digital-snapshot-scene-reports from nights out, art events and concerts, I started editing and presenting portfolios of other peoples’ photography and artwork. This turned the site into a kind of free-form gallery space, where new and interesting work was showcased to a growing global audience. I had an open call for submissions prompt on site, and as the link got shared the submissions multiplied exponentially. The site grew and grew. This was before and during the beginning of what became social media. The giant corporate platforms hadn’t absorbed and flattened everything yet, and the aggregate nature of the site caused its audience to spread. At its peak the site was visited by thousands of people a day and I was receiving  dozens of daily submissions from all over the world.</p>

      <p>A little over a year after the site started I was invited by Spencer Brownstone Gallery to put together a group exhibition based on the website. This show would be the first of a series of tinyvices group shows I was invited to organize for galleries around the world. These shows expanded the project out of the digital space which led me to start a small, print-on-demand imprint called TV Books. I also partnered with Aperture on a tinyvices series of artist monographs.</p>
